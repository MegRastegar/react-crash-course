# react-crash-course

This repository documents my personal journey of learning **React** through hands-on practice.  
I followed the excellent [React Crash Course by freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04), building five progressively more challenging projects to solidify core React concepts.

## What I Learned

Through these projects, I explored and practiced:

- React components & props
- Managing state with `useState`
- Handling side effects with `useEffect`
- Accessibility considerations for screen reader users
- Component architecture and reusability
- Writing clean and organized JSX

## Projects

1. **React Facts**  
   A simple static React page displaying interesting facts about React itself.

2. **Meme Generator**  
   Generates a random meme image and lets the user add custom top/bottom text using form inputs.

3. **Travel Journal**  
   A travel-themed layout that showcases trip entries with images and descriptions using reusable components.

4. **Tenzies**  
   A browser-based version of the classic Tenzies game â€” roll 10 dice and try to get all of them to match by locking selected ones.

5. **Assembly: Endgame**  
   A twist on the classic Hangman game where every wrong guess eliminates a programming language. If you lose, only Assembly remains.
