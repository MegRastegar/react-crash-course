# Travel Journal

This project is a React application built with Vite, created to learn how to use an external `data.js` file to extract and map data into reusable components for a travel journal website.

## Overview

In this project, I learned how to:

- Organize and export data from a separate `data.js` file.
- Import and extract data in React components.
- Use `.map()` to dynamically render multiple reusable entries based on the data.
- Create reusable components to display travel journal entries.

This method keeps data and UI logic separate, making the app easier to maintain and scale.

## Features

- Data stored in a modular `data.js` file.
- Dynamic rendering of journal entries using Reactâ€™s `.map()`.
- Clean, reusable component structure.
- Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
