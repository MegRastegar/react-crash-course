# Tenzies

A playful web version of the classic children’s game **Tenzies**, built as part of my React learning journey.

In this game, the goal is simple: **Roll until all 10 dice show the same number**. You can “hold” dice to keep their values between rolls and try to match them all!

## Features

- Roll 10 dice at once
- Hold individual dice to keep their values
- Win the game by getting all dice to match
- Basic accessibility features for screen reader users

## What I Learned

This project helped me dive deeper into:

- React state management (`useState`)
- Conditional rendering and game logic
- Handling user interactions and UI updates
- **Building with accessibility in mind** — adding screen reader support and thinking about inclusive UI/UX
