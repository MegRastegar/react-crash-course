# Meme Generator

A simple and fun web app that generates random memes and lets you add custom text to them.

This project is a small part of my React learning journey, where I explored concepts like **state management** and **side effects** using **Vite + React**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Loads a random meme image from an API
- ✍️ Allows users to add custom top and bottom text
- 🔄 Generates a new meme image at the click of a button
- ⚛️ Built using React functional components with hooks

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me understand:

- `useState` for managing component state
- `useEffect` for handling side effects like fetching data
- Prop drilling and component structure in React
