# Assembly: Endgame

A web-based game inspired by the classic **Hangman**, but with a darkly humorous twist: each incorrect guess eliminates a popular programming language... until only **Assembly** is left standing.

Scary, huh?

## Gameplay

- Guess the word one letter at a time.
- Each wrong guess "snaps away" one programming language from existence.
- Lose the game, and you're left coding in Assembly — the last language standing.
- Win the game, and you save developers everywhere from that fate.

It’s Hangman... for coders.

## Features

- On-screen keyboard for letter selection
- Dynamic elimination of languages with each mistake
- Fun theme with a programmer’s twist
- Accessible UI with screen reader–friendly features

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- JavaScript
- [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) for dynamic class names
- HTML + CSS

## What I Learned

This was the **largest and most exciting project** in my React learning journey so far.

I practiced and refined:

- Component composition and state handling
- Event handling and conditional UI rendering
- Working with utility libraries like `clsx`
- Designing for **accessibility** using screen reader–only content and thoughtful interactions

## Accessibility

Throughout the app, I included screen-reader-only features to support inclusive gameplay. Accessibility continues to be a key focus in how I approach front-end development.
